# friendly-finder
The other projects in _Logro_ capture data about users, but I think it would be useful to display friend connections, especially if I can capture information about users that trust me with their social data.

# Goals in Leveraging Data
With the project friendly-finder, I hope to leverage social networks to highlight connections between people. The hope is that people who use this app will have a more enriched view of how their views/beliefs/emtoions/etc. relate to others.

Moreover, the ability to share will always be 'opt-in' (with _Logro_) and the user will additionally have options to authorize which friends (if any) they want to share their data with. While this may hinder the sharing process, it is meant to maintain people's dignity and trust. After all we want to be respecting of that trust, especially when we reference personal data, sharing introspective ideas, and personal reflection with one another.

# Notes:
* For some time, this project probably will not have much done with it
* It's a vertical slice of something important
* Additionally, it is something important for a BETA+ feature set
* This means that it won't be completed for a while (Written Apri; 2016).
* The goal is not to be a social network, but rather it ought to extend other social networks.
* The more I think about this, in a slow daily way, the more I consider that this should also be something that kindly applauds the user for connecting inwardly and outwardly.
* 'Extrospection' is part of the basis for this project, and how extrospection relates to introspection
